Changes in population due to migration, birth or death may not be accurately reflected in latest population estimates. If a country has seen increasing migration trends or if a national population statistic is lower than the count recorded in statistical calculations, it can result in a vaccination coverage percentage greater than 100%.
 Changes in population due to migration, birth or death may not be accurately reflected in latest population estimates. If a country has seen increasing migration trends or if a national population statistic is lower than the count recorded in statistical calculations, it can result in a vaccination coverage percentage greater than 100%. Number of doses administered in a country, area, or territory, regardless of if they have been administered as part of a primary series or as booster/additional doses. COVID-19 vaccination data are collected via WHO regional office-specific systems for monitoring COVID-19 vaccination uptake. These data are pooled from numerous sources, including direct reports from Member States, WHO review of publicly available official data, or data collected and published by third-party sites. Data published by third-party sites have not been validated by WHO, and WHO cannot comment on accuracy or completeness. Differences in counts may occur compared to other sources, due to different inclusion criteria and data cut-off times. Estimated populations and projections are drawn from: *Total population for France has been adjusted to account for the following overseas territories (French Guiana, Guadeloupe, Martinique, Mayotte, Réunion, Saint Martin). Where multiple vaccines are used in a country, are, or territory, the start date displayed is equivalent to start date of the first vaccine product introduced. Suspensions (temporary or otherwise) of vaccination rollout are not taken into
consideration. The information contained in this dashboard does not in any way imply endorsement, certification, warranty of fitness, or recommendation by WHO of any company or of any vaccine or other product for any purpose and does not imply preference
over vaccines or other products of a similar nature that are not mentioned. WHO furthermore does not warrant that the vaccines or other products listed are of acceptable quality, have obtained regulatory approval in any country, or
that their use is otherwise in accordance with the national laws and regulations of any country, including but not limited to patent laws. The inclusion of vaccines or other products in these analyses and underlying datasets does not
imply any approval by WHO of the vaccines or other products in question (which is the sole prerogative of national authorities).
